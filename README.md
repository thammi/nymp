# nymp

## About

nymp is a graphical command line client for xmms2. It is library focused and
provides a tree view on your collection.

## Status

The project is already usable but there is still some missing functionality. The
author uses it on a daily basis. See the 'TODO' file for a (probably incomplete
and outdatet) list of planned additional features.

## Usage

The key bindings are subject to change in the near future. They are loosely
vim-oriented.

Incomplete overview:

* p - play/pause
* d - delete from playlist
* j/k - navigate
* h/l/tab - change column (library/playlist)
* a - append to playlist
* enter - collapse tree node/jump to playlist item
* space - mark/unmark item
* alt+space - unmark all

You can use the mouse, too.
